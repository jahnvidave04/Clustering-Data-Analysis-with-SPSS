# Clustering Data-Analysis-using-SPSS
Clustering Analysis is a method to classify objects or cases into homogenous groups known as clusters. Clustering Analysis is also called Classification Analysis.

# Conducting Clustering Analysis consist of below steps:
1) Problem Formation

2) Choosing Distance Measure

3) Choosing Clustering Procedure

4) Finalizing appropriate number of clusters

5) Analyze clusters and state profiles

# Problem
A small law and Garden firm is interested in understanding the landscape of consumers in the L&G marked based on a host of demographic, behavioral and psychographic variables. The task is to provide them with the best segmentation schema guided by data and create segment personas so that they can effectively market their services.
Set of vairables to be used in the clustering process:
* Q20: Respondent L&G knowledge level
* Q21: Respondent L&G participation interest level
* Q22: Statement agreement about L&G care
* Q23: Respondent desired status of law and garden
* Q24: Main reason grow/have plants
* Q26: Main reason maintain lawn
  
Set of Educational variables to be used for profiling are as below:
* Q3: Age
* Q4: Gender
* Q40: Marital Status
* Q41: Education

First we analyze the data using Hierarchial clustering method which helped in identifying step where the jump is present and finalize the number of clusters.

Second step was to do K-Means analysis using selected number of clusters. After running the analysis we can deduce the most engaged cluster. 

Following are the statistics and Analysis:

From above analysis and graphs we can say there is a strong cluster formation of male who are age of 34 with Bachelors degree and are married. To target more advertising then firm should focus on the habits of this people. The firm should utilize targeted advertising channels to reach the audience and platforms like social media, online forums, websites that are popular among individuals of mid-thirties should be highlighted. Consider loyalty and reward programs, ensure customer services meets needs of targeted audience and establish a feedback system to understand evolving preference of targeted audience.
